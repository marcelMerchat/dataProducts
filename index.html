<H4>A Project for the John Hopkins Coursera Data Product Class</H4>
<H5>Prepared by Marcel Merchat</H5>
<H5>April 3, 2016</H5>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>
<H5>This website explores possible explanations and relationships                
 of water level fluctuations of Lake Huron which lies                  between 
the United States and Canada. It also includes                 Lake Michigan 
because the two lakes are joined near Mackinac                 Island. The 
common level of these very large lakes is more like                 an ocean 
than a river or typical lake because they                  do not seem to be 
related to the amount of rain. The lake level                  can only change 
about a foot over a period of many months.                There are short term 
fluctuations of up to 10-feet or more due                to high wind and waves 
but these average to zero when the                weather returns to calm 
conditions.</H5>
<H3>Raw Data for Analysis</H3>
<H5>The basic R program is distributed with three standard                 
datasets that we use to analyze and predict the level                of Lake 
Huron. We use the following datasets for our analysis.</H5>
<H5>A. LakeHuron - Annual Lake Levels starting in 1875</H5>
<H5>B. sunspot.month - Monthly sunspot count starting in 1749</H5>
<H5>C. nhtemp - Annual temperatures in New Haven, CT                from 
1912-1971.</H5></FORM></DIV>
<DIV class="col-sm-8">
<H3>Raw Data for the Analysis</H3>
<H5>In order to expore the fluctuations                 of Lake Huron, we built 
a data frame for                the 58 years from 1914-1971 using                
the R datasets described in the left column.                The derived data 
frame lists the temperature, sunspot,                 and lake level data for 
direct comparison and analysis. The                 three-year running averages 
of the temperature and sunspot                counts taken from the raw R 
datasets are listed in the new                data frame. The code for this is 
part of the server program.</H5>
<H3>Exploratory Plots:</H3>
<H4>Running Three-Year Average Temperature</H4>
<H5>Figure-1 below shows that the lake levels were often high                
when the three-year running average temperature was low                as was 
the case just before 1920, but the reverse did not hold                when the 
temperature later increased during the period                from 
1940-1954.</H5>
<H5>Enter 1 into the box below to see a plot of the effect                   of 
temperature.</H5>
<H4>Sunspot Activity:</H4>
<H5>High lake levels coincided with high sunspot counts and the                
level peaked with sunspot activity in the period before 1935                and 
after 1965, but this did not hold as the temperature                increased 
during the years from 1940-1954.</H5>
<H5>Enter 2 into the box below to see a plot of the effect                   of 
sunspot activity. To compare temperature and sunspot                    levels, 
enter 3 into the box.</H5>
<H3>Choose Desired Plot:</H3>
<H5>Enter 1, 2, or three as follows:</H5>
<H5>1 - Lake Level and New Haven Temperature</H5>
<H5>2 - Lake Level and Sunspot Count</H5>
<H5>3 - Sunspot Count and New Haven Temperature</H5>

<H3>Regression Analysis:</H3>
<H5>In order to expore the level fluctuations of Lake Huron,                we 
built a regression model using the lm function                in an attempt to 
predict the lake level from                the three-year running temperature 
and sunspot counts.                Our model includes an interactive term data 
frame for joint                   sunspot-temperature interaction.</H5>
<H3>Regression Model</H3>
<H5>The model is based on temperature dependance with                 adjustment 
for sunspot level. The sunspot level is                 represented as a binary 
high or low variable.</H5>
<H5>Red dots in Figure-2 below represent high sunspot                     years 
when the level was higher than the 75th percentile                   which 
corresponded 1075 sunspots per year. Black dots indicate                   
average and sunspot levels below 1075.                   The limit of 1075 
sunspots that defines high and low sunspot                   years can be 
adjusted using the slider below.</H5>
<H4>Conditioning Effect of Temperature</H4>
<H5>High lake levels coincided with high sunspot counts for                 both 
high and low temperatures. The lake level was about                 average for 
sunspot levels greater than the 75th percentile.                  Low lake 
levels only occurred when sunspot counts were low.</H5>
<H5>The red line in Figure-2 is the best fit line for                 high 
sunspot years when the level was higher than                 the 75th percentile 
which corresponded 1075 sunspots per year.                 The black line is the 
best fit line for average and lower                 sunspot levels. The limit of 
1075 sunspots that defines high                and low sunspot years can be 
adjusted using the slider below.</H5>
<H4>Adjust High-Count Sunspot Detection Limit</H4>
<H5>Use the the slider below to raise the limit                   for inclusion 
as a high sunspot year.</H5>

<H5>The highest sunspot levels corresponded to above average                  
temperatures and high lake levels. To see the effect of the                 
highest sunspot counts of 1375 or more, adjust the slider                 to 300 
at the right side. The red line in Figure-2 indicates                 the 
expected lake level increases with temperature                 in this 
case.</H5></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
